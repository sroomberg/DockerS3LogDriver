This is a docker logs driver that will allow you to publish 
docker logs to a S3 bucket.

To configure this driver for use with your container and then a subsequent running of your container 
with the driver please follow the [Docker logging configuration instructions](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/).
